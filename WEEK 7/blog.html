        <h2>TRUE CRIME IN THE 1900's</h2>
        <p class="quote">True crime stories have a firm hold on the popular imagination with an ever-increasing 
            number of books, television shows, and podcasts devoted to the subject. This interest has played out 
            in both fiction and nonfiction. It might seem a distinctly modern preoccupation stemming from advances
            in forensic science that make it possible to precisely analyze the elements of a crime scene and 
            reconstruct what happened. However, this fascination goes back at least to the nineteenth century when
            New York newspapers of the 1890s competed to outdo each other with lurid crime stories and graphic 
            accounts of murder were standard in Victorian tabloids.</p>
        <p>There are numerous theories attempting to explain this phenomenon. One idea is that people like to see 
            justice served. Numerous authors have made studies of past murders with the advantage of a historical 
            perspective and modern science to find the truth, but there is a special fascination for cases that have
            not been conclusively resolved. Lizzie Borden—acquitted of the murder of her father and stepmother—and 
            Jack the Ripper—whose identity has never been established—have both inspired many books that attempt to 
            reconstruct and solve the crimes. In addition to historical accounts, there are also novels in which Lizzie
            Borden battles Lovecraftian monsters and Jack the Ripper goes up against a werewolf, Sherlock Holmes, and 
            the Elephant Man. True crime stories can satisfy the interests of readers who want to see justice satisfied
            as well as those who want to solve the crimes themselves.</p>
        <p>One of history’s deadliest serial killers was a married family man who managed to squeeze in 218 credited
            murders (and as many as 250) while working as a popular British physician. Harold Shipman began his murderous
            spree in 1972, and it’s believed he killed at least 71 patients while working at his first practice, and 
            doubled that number at a second practice he joined after butting heads with colleagues who found him arrogant,
            brusque and overconfident.</p>

        <h2>HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF</h2>
        <p class="quote">Self-defense actually starts before needing to react to the worst-case scenario—with self-awareness
            and preventive strategies. The first step is paying attention to your surroundings. That means only walking and 
            parking in well-lit areas. Keep your keys (with a safety whistle, defense spray, or safety necklace, if you desire)
            easily accessible as you approach your car or front door. </p>
        <p>While it's easy to think about obvious situations where you might be attacked, there are those that aren't so obvious,
             namely when you're in your car. Women have a tendency to get into their car and sit while they check messages—a habit
              that can actually spell trouble. "If a predator is watching you, this is the perfect opportunity for that person to 
              get in the passenger side, [threaten you], and tell you where to go," says Jory. That's why as soon as you get in the
               car, as a matter of habit, you should immediately lock the doors and leave.</p>
        <p>If you're at a party, stick with friends, and if you've left a drink out of sight even for a few seconds, get a new one. 
            "Spiking a drink with a date rape drug can happen quickly," Jory says. When going on a date, tell family or friends where
             you're going, especially if this is a first date or blind date. If somebody pushes you to do something you don't want to
              do, know that you have a right to leave. And of course, charge your cell phone and keep it and a charger on you at all 
              times.</p>
